## 5-Minute Demo Script

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"This is Celestial Siege, a tower defense game I built to demonstrate client-server architecture. The backend is C++ handling all game logic, while the frontend is pure JavaScript for rendering. They communicate via WebSocket with JSON messages."

### Live Gameplay (1 minute)
- Show the game running
- Place several towers strategically
- Point out automatic targeting
- Show resource management
- Demonstrate wave progression

### Architecture Overview (1 minute)
- Open developer tools
- Show network tab (if using real server)
- Explain state broadcasting
- Show JSON message structure
- Highlight 60 FPS performance

### Code Walkthrough (1.5 minutes)
```cpp
// Show GameObject hierarchy
class GameObject {
    virtual void update(double deltaTime);
    virtual json toJson() const;
};

// Show clean separation
class Tower : public GameObject {
    void fire() { cooldown = 1.0 / fireRate; }
};
```

### Extensibility Demo (1 minute)
"Adding new features is straightforward..."
- Show how to add a new tower type
- Explain the rendering configuration
- Demonstrate hot-reload with mock server

### Wrap-up (30 seconds)
- "Built with modern C++17 and ES6"
- "Scalable architecture for multiplayer"
- "Complete documentation available"
- "Ready for additional features"

## Technical Highlights to Emphasize

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Server Authority**: "All game logic runs on the server, preventing cheating"
2. **Stateless Client**: "The frontend is purely for rendering and input"
3. **JSON Protocol**: "Human-readable messages for easy debugging"

### Code Quality
1. **RAII**: "Using smart pointers for automatic memory management"
2. **Polymorphism**: "GameObject hierarchy allows easy extension"
3. **Const Correctness**: "Preventing accidental modifications"

### Performance
1. **60 FPS**: "Smooth gameplay with efficient update loops"
2. **Object Pooling**: "Ready to implement for better performance"
3. **Spatial Partitioning**: "Architecture supports quadtree optimization"

## Interview Talking Points

### Design Decisions

**Q: Why separate backend and frontend?**
"This architecture allows multiple clients, prevents cheating, and enables different frontends (mobile, desktop) without changing game logic."

**Q: Why C++ for the backend?**
"C++ provides deterministic performance crucial for real-time games, plus I wanted to demonstrate proficiency in systems programming."

**Q: Why custom libraries?**
"To reduce dependencies and show understanding of underlying concepts. In production, I'd use battle-tested libraries like Beast for WebSocket."

### Technical Challenges

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
"Creating the mock WebSocket server. I realized during development that requiring C++ compilation would hurt demo accessibility, so I built a complete game simulation in JavaScript that maintains the same architecture."

**Q: How would you handle lag?**
"Client-side prediction with server reconciliation. The client would simulate movement locally, then correct based on server authority."

**Q: How would you scale this?**
"Spatial partitioning for physics, interest management for networking, and dedicated game instances for matches."

### Future Enhancements

**Q: What would you add next?**
1. "Pathfinding with A* algorithm"
2. "Multiple tower types with upgrade paths"
3. "Particle effects for visual polish"
4. "Multiplayer with room system"

**Q: How would you monetize?**
"Free-to-play with cosmetic tower skins, or premium with level packs. The architecture supports either model."

## Code Metrics

### Complexity Analysis
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Low (most methods under 10)
- **Coupling**: Loose (interfaces well-defined)
- **Cohesion**: High (single responsibility)

### Performance Metrics
- **Update Loop**: O(n) for n objects
- **Collision Detection**: O(nÂ²) currently, O(n log n) with quadtree
- **Memory Usage**: ~1KB per game object

### Scalability
- **Players**: Architecture supports unlimited viewers, 2-4 active players
- **Objects**: Tested with 200+ simultaneous objects
- **Network**: ~5KB/second bandwidth per client

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
"The architecture is production-ready. It needs real WebSocket library integration and game balance tuning, which I estimate at 1-2 weeks of work."

**Q: Why not use a game engine?**
"I wanted to demonstrate understanding of fundamental concepts and show I can build systems from scratch when needed."

**Q: What did you learn?**
"The importance of architecture decisions early on. The mock server wasn't planned but became essential for demos. It reinforced the value of loose coupling."

**Q: Would you do anything differently?**
"I'd implement the real WebSocket library first, then create the mock. But the current approach led to better architecture since the mock forced clean interfaces."

## Final Tips

1. **Run the demo before the interview** - Ensure everything works
2. **Have code open** - Be ready to show specific implementations
3. **Know the numbers** - FPS, object counts, line counts
4. **Prepare variations** - Different demo lengths (2, 5, 10 minutes)
5. **Show enthusiasm** - This is your code, be proud of it!

Remember: This project demonstrates not just coding ability, but also architecture design, problem-solving (mock server), and professional software development practices.
